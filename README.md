# OS-Scratch
An extremely rudimentary operating system, developed in C. The development environment was in a AWS Linux instance, so the code was entirely written through an ssh connection.

The operating system, found entirely in "myos.iso", can be emulated through VirtualBox. It features a working terminal, with the ability to print multiple colors.
